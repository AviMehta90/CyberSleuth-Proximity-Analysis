# DV Project - VAST MC 1 2020

To identify the hackers, the task at hand involves examining CGCS records to pinpoint groups that closely match a profile identified by CGCS sociopsychologists. The researchers at the Center for Global Cyber Strategy (CGCS) have utilized data from white hat groups to create anonymized profiles of various groups. Among these profiles, some have been singled out as closely resembling the structure of the group responsible for the recent internet outage. The objective is to analyze CGCS records and identify groups that best fit the identified profile, contributing to the identification of the hackers behind the recent internet outage.
